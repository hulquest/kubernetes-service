== Add a Workspace

Log in to https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] and navigate to *Organization -> Workspaces*. You will see the list of current workspaces displayed.

You can now add a *Workspace Name* and choose which *Teams* will have access to this workspace. In this example, we'll name it _Version 2_ and include the _New Features_ and _QA_ teams.

Pressing the *SUBMIT* button will create the new workspace and return us to the *Workspaces* screen. Notice the new workspace _Version 2_ has been added to the list.
