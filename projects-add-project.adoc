Learn how to add a project to your NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS) account. Projects let you organize workloads and simplify deployment. Each Project is assigned to a single Workspace. Projects can have multiple cluster and any combination of Solutions (including Applications, Trackers, and Packages).

**Requirements:**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A cluster created in the desired Workspace.

To begin, click **Projects** then **+ Project**.
