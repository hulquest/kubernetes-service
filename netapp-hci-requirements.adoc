= NetApp HCI Requirements

Before you use NKS on NetApp HCI, you should complete all of the necessary networking and other requirements. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/hci/docs/reference_requirements_beforeyoubegin.html[Click here for a full list of the current requirements]. 

== More NetApp HCI Resources

If you have any of the following issues:

* Replica pods deployed on different worker nodes. Tridentâ€™s guardrails prohibit the PVC Access Mode RWX with an iSCSI driver.  In this case, no pods will come up.
* Kubernetes Rolling Updates unsuccessful when a persistent volume is attached to the pod with iSCSI.
* Ungraceful Kubernetes worker node loss due to multi-attach errors when RWO is configured.
