= Getting Started: Checklist

Here's a checklist of introductory, "Day 1" tasks for setting up your NKS account.

== User Access

See our article on https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/getting-started-user-access.html[Setting up user access] for more details.

**Organization**

* Choose the email address for your main NKS account.
* Set up the NKS account for this address.
* Create a new company organization.

**Workspaces**

* Set up workspaces for the broadest user categories, if applicable.

**Teams**

* Set up teams for fine-grained control of user groups.

**Members**

* Invite members to your new organization.
* If you have your own NKS account, be sure to invite yourself.
* Choose the right privilege levels. Users with Admin rights can view and change the billing, subscription, and provider keys on the entire account.

== Provider Credentials

* Add your provider credentials to your organization. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/getting-started-add-credentials.html[More information]
