= Test Your Istio Cross-Cluster Mesh

Learn how to deploy a custom demo to visually test out your Istio cross-cluster mesh.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up and demonstrating a two-cluster Istio cross-cluster mesh. The clusters can be created on the same service, or across different services (like AWS and GKE).

To demonstrate the mesh, we will install a customized version of Istio's Bookinfo example application. The Bookinfo app creates a book review on a web page, which you can view at the provided URL.

The Bookinfo app comes in three versions. Each version has a different decoration on the book rating:

* Version 1: No stars.
* Version 2: Black stars.
* Version 3: Red stars.

We will install version 1 on cluster A, and version 3 on cluster B. Thus, when you see a “no stars” review, you know you are looking at cluster A. If you see a “red stars” review, you are looking at cluster B.

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/assets/istio-cross-cluster-demo.zip[Download the .zip file which contains the custom Istio files for this tutorial.] Uncompress the file's contents into the directory of your choice.
* Two clusters provisioned and added to an Istio mesh. For step-by-step instructions, see our article https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/create-an-istio-mesh.html[Create an Istio Mesh].
* Kubectl installed, so that you can use each cluster's `kubeconfig` file to deploy the Istio manifests. For step-by-step instructions on installing Kubectl and using `kubeconfig` files, see our article
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/kubernetes-service/install-kubectl-to-control-a-kubernetes-cluster.html[Install Kubectl to Control a Kubernetes Cluster].

== Prep Cluster A

In this section, you will set up cluster A to serve version 1 (no stars) of the Bookinfo application.

=== Push Bookinfo to Cluster A

Go to the NKS Control Plane and click on cluster A to go to the Cluster Details page. On the left-hand side of the screen, click to download the `kubeconfig` file for this cluster. Move the `kubeconfig` file to your Kubectl home directory.

Push the custom Bookinfo manifest to cluster A:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f cluster-a-bookinfo-manifests.yaml
----

=== Customize Cluster A

In the next steps you will check the egress rule on cluster A to find the host info for cluster B. You then add the host info for cluster B to the `destinationrule.yaml` and `splitter.yaml` files, so that cluster A knows where to send traffic.

**Get Cluster B Host Info**

On cluster A, check the egress rule to find the host info for cluster B:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe serviceentry spccc-egress-service-entry
----

Look for the section which reads:

[source,shell]
----
    Spec:
      Endpoints:
        Address:  35.199.144.87
      Hosts:
        svc.netpgcxz4x.remote
----

Just to double-check, the IP address here should match the Istio IP of cluster B.

Get the Hosts name for cluster B (in this example, `svc.netpgcxz4x.remote`).

**Create the DestinationRule**

Paste the host info for cluster B into `destinationrule.yaml` under `host` so that it reads:

[source,shell]
----
    spec:
      host: svc.netpgcxz4x.remote
----

Save the file. Push it to cluster A:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f destinationrule.
----

**Create the Splitter**

Paste the host info for cluster B into the `splitter.yaml` file. The host info needs to be added in two places:

[source,shell]
----
  http:
  - rewrite:
      authority: reviews.default.[Cluster B host info]
    route:
    - destination:
        host: [Cluster B host info]
----

In this example, you would change this to read:

[source,shell]
----
http:
- rewrite:
    authority: reviews.default.svc.netpgcxz4x.remote
  route:
  - destination:
      host: svc.netpgcxz4x.remote
----

Save this file. Push it to cluster A:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f splitter.yaml
----

== Prep Cluster B

Now you will set up cluster B to serve version 3 (red stars) of the Bookinfo application.

Get the `kubeconfig` file for cluster B and update your kubectl environment. Then push the custom Bookinfo manifest to cluster B:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f cluster-b-bookinfo-manifests.yaml
----

== View the Demo

From the main NKS Control Plane, click to view the details of cluster A. Find the Istio Ingress URL, and append it with `/productpage` to view Bookinfo, like:

http://35.227.159.142/productpage

Repeatedly refresh the page. You will see the same review with either no stars or red stars. This demonstrates that traffic is being split between the two clusters.
