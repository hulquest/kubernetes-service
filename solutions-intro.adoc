* link:solutions-add-solution-from-gitlab.html[Add a GitLab Solution]

**Requirements**

* An NKS account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.
* A Project set up and configured on your NKS account.
* An NKS cluster with Build Version: `Classic`.
* An application in an external repository.
* An SSH keypair for use as the deploy key. To learn how to generate an SSH keypair, we recommend https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key[this GitHub article].

WARNING: You must create the SSH keypair without a passphrase.
