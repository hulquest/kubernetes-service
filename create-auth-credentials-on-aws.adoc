= Find Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials

To create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] you will need the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You can find these in the `credentials.csv` file which you downloaded when you created the user.

You can only view or download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key when you create the user or the user's access key. However, you can create new access keys at any time.

== Create a New AWS Access Key

If you no longer have the `credentials.csv` file which you downloaded when you created the AWS user, you can create a new access key at any time.

Sign in to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[AWS Management Console]. In the **Find Services** section, search for `IAM`. Click the search result for `IAM: Manage User Access and Encryption Keys`.
