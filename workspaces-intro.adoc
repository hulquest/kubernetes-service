= Workspaces

The https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)] Workspace allows you to group together Projects, Teams, and Members. This lets you tailor access to the exact needs of a group of users.

For example, you may want to allow a certain team access to build and manage clusters at one particular provider. This can be accomplished by creating a workspace for that team (or teams). Then assign specific *Provider Credentials* to that workspace. The same process can be used to enable or restrict access to other resources found under *Setup*:

* Provider Credentials
* Solution Credentials
* Storage Credentials
* VCS (Version Control System) Credentials
* SSH Keys
