NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS) is a universal control plane for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters. If you don't already have an NKS account, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial with no credit card required at https://nks.netapp.io.

== Getting Started

Welcome to NKS! Read through our series of Getting Started articles for an overview of the process, and learn how to start off right by setting up your NKS account.

* link:getting-started-working-with-clusters.html[Working with NKS Kubernetes Clusters]

== Add Credentials

Provider credentials are the authorization keys for your account on AWS, NetApp HCI, Azure, and other supported providers. This lets you create clusters on the supported provider of your choice.

Get step-by-step instructions for adding provider credentials for:

* link:create-auth-credentials-on-gke.html[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Credentials]

== Create a Kubernetes Cluster

After you set up your NKS account, it's time to create a Kubernetes cluster.

Learn how to create a cluster at the provider of your choice with our step-by-step guides:

* link:create-eks-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Amazon EKS]
* link:create-azure-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Azure]
* link:create-anf-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster with Azure NetApp Files (ANF)]s
* link:create-aks-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Microsoft AKS]
* link:create-flexpod-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on FlexPod]
* link:create-gce-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Compute Engine (GCE)]
* link:create-gke-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)]
* link:create-netapp-hci-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on NetApp HCI Cluster]
* link:create-vmware-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on VMware]

== Manage Access

Learn how to use NKS Teams and Workspaces to manage access for your users. NKS lets you set up multiple levels of access, so that you can restrict authorization keys to certain groups of users, prevent users from one group from creating or deleting clusters in another group's Workspace, and more.

* link:add-a-team.html[Add a Team]
* link:add-a-workspace.html[Add a Workspace]
* link:ssh-to-a-node-in-an-nks-cluster.html[SSH to a Node in an NKS Cluster]

== Cluster Lifecycle

You have set up your NKS account, and launched one or more Kubernetes clusters. Now what? Learn more about how to use and extend NKS, and how to automate your NKS workflow with our new Terraform provider.

* link:intro-to-terraform-on-nks.html[Terraform on NKS]

== Solutions

Solutions provide a developer-friendly Git workflow which lets you deploy your application to an NKS Kubernetes cluster with a few clicks.

* link:solutions-add-solution-from-github.html[Add a Solution from GitHub]
* link:solutions-add-solution-from-bitbucket.html[Add a Solution from Bitbucket]

== Private Registry

The private registry lets you push a Docker image or Helm chart directly to a Kubernetes cluster on NKS. This provides security and privacy for your app. It also makes it easy to migrate your app from your desktop or development server to the cloud, using NKS.

* link:private-registry-intro.html[Intro to Private Registry]

== NetApp HCI

Get started with NetApp HCI on NKS by reading our guides on the following topics:

* link:netapp-hci-requirements.html[NetApp HCI Requirements]
* link:hci-enable-nks-for-netapp-hci.html[Enable NKS for NetApp HCI]
* link:create-netapp-hci-cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes Cluster on NetApp HCI]

== Istio

Use Istio to create a service mesh with your NKS Kubernetes clusters.

* link:istio-create-cross-cluster-mesh.html[Create an Istio Mesh]
* link:istio-test-cross-cluster-mesh.html[Test an Istio Cross-Cluster Mesh]

== API

Interested in doing things programmatically instead of clicking through a UI? Check out our API. We provide full access to the NKS services through the API. Anything you can do in the UI, you can do through the API as well.
